					<h4>Coding Experience</h4>
					<hr>
					<p>I first learnt the basics of Python during Year 10/11 when I was required to code a simple maths quiz. For this, we had to program the code to ask the questions, generate a final score and then export that score to a CSV file containing other scores.</p>
					<p>Next, Python was one of the languages we are being given an introduction into as part of the second year university module, along with R for data analysis and C.</p>
                    <p>During the Covid-19 crisis, I explored Python further by gaining an insight into Django and Flask. I learnt the basics of SQL and applied them to the framework knowledge I had.</p>
                    <p>I have documented all of my beginner projects on GitHub, as well as some more difficult projects using Django and Flask. These include a portfolio website using Django, a basic calculator using Tkinter and a To-Do web app using Flask.</p>

					<h4>Coding Interest</h4>
					<hr>
					<p>Coding appeals to me because it simply makes sense. It forms the basis of so much of the technology we use on a day to day basis, therefore progressing and creating new technologies and software is something that I can picture myself doing successfully.</p>
					<p>Software engineering is something that will play a big part in the future of technology and already plays an important part in many major sectors we depend on everyday; finance, energy, business and many more. I believe I can contribute a lot to this and be an integral member of a team to lead the way in new software and coding.</p>
                    <p>For me, programming is a way of making tasks more efficient, whether it be scraping data from an online database to create graphs/conclusions, or solving problems which have troubled many generations before us. Coding is something that can and does make a difference for the better.</p>
